## 🎯 About Me

I’m a **developer who enjoys building both interactive game experiences and real-world systems**.

🎮 As a **game developer**, I work with **Unity (2D & 3D)** and have basic hands-on experience with **Godot Engine**, focusing on gameplay mechanics, enemy behavior, physics-based interactions, animations, and UI systems.

🌐 As a **full-stack developer**, I build scalable web applications using **Django, React, and the MERN stack**, and I enjoy automation projects that integrate **hardware and software**.

* Strong programming fundamentals & OOP
* Experience with internships & team projects
* Curious about VR / immersive systems
* Actively practicing problem-solving & DSA
